# topics — vetted catalog for `mock` and `generate`

A curated set of system-design problems, tagged by difficulty and by the dimension(s) they stress. Use as the default suggestion list when a user runs `mock` or `generate` without a topic.

**Tagging key:**
- **Difficulty**: `easy` (warmup, ~30 min), `medium` (canonical 45-min mock), `hard` (staff bar, multiple deep dives), `staff+` (principal-level, requires multi-region or novel substrate).
- **Dimensions**: which of the 5 scoring dimensions the problem most stresses. (Most problems stress all five; the tag picks out where the *teeth* are.)
- **Slug**: stable identifier for `runs.md` / `weaknesses.md` entries.

## Modern (LLM-era / 2024–2026)

## Selection guidance

When the user asks for a problem and hasn't specified one:

1. **First mock ever** → suggest from `easy`. Build the rhythm before the depth.
2. **Practicing for a specific company** → mix domain-deep matches with one canonical medium for breadth.
3. **Targeting staff/principal** → at least half from `hard` or `staff+`. Never default to easy at this level.
4. **AI-native company** → bias toward `modern` plus one classic to test fundamentals.
5. **Want to find your weak spot** → cross-reference `weaknesses.md`. If `tradeoff` is the recurring gap, suggest a topic where the deep-dive forces a binary choice (e.g., `google-docs` for OT-vs-CRDT, `payments` for ledger-vs-event-sourcing).

When the user asks `generate` without a topic: pick from `modern` first (less reference material exists, so a generated rubric is more useful), then `staff+` (fewer canonical worked examples to crib from).
